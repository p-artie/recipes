Hello!

I've started to get back into coding. Lately, I've been working in Product Management. I've moved away from coding. I'd like to get back. At work, I reached out to the engineering department and started discussions around moving over to the engineering department. It was a great talk. I've started working on the Odin Project to help get back into it. From here, I'll work on learning Java and the Spring Framework.
